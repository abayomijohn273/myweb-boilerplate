# My Web Development Starter

This is my website development starter for faster development and speeding across the hassle of creating and configuring a new website project 
(Note: This starter doesn't include any framework like React, Vue, etc and also using the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/) writing conventions.)

- NPM scripts
- Module bundling with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- Image optimisation (via Parcel’s [imagemin](https://github.com/DeMoorJasper/parcel-plugin-imagemin) plugin)
- SVG icon sprite creation (via Parcel’s [svg-sprite](https://github.com/Epimodev/parcel-plugin-svg-sprite))
- Node Sass
